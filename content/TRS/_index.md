Part one of this book details a theory of Term Rewriting Systems, solely based on sound reasoning. Minimal Magc refers to a minimisation of assumptions: there are almost none, and, in principle, no previous knowledge is required.

Part two discusses an implementation. That implementation can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/BabelfishNL/Tram.git).

Part three practical applications of term rewriting systems: how programs written in C can be converted to a TRS, or vice-versa.
