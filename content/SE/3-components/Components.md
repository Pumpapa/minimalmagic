# Adders

A **half adder** is a component which adds the right-most bits of two numbers. It takes two inputs and produces two outputs: the sum and the carry. *Note how the component does the same as we do when we add two numbers!*

A ***full adder*** is a component which adds other bits of two numbers. It takes three inputs (two operands and the carry from additions to the left) and produces two outputs: the sum and the carry.

For obvious reasons trivial components such as one bit adders are often drawn as components (not showing the gates).

# Larger components

From these parts larger components can be created. This is an N-bit adder, made from one half-adder and (N-1) full adders.

In general, any component can be designed by breaking it down in Boolean functions, truth tables and gates.

## Decoder

A one-of-eight decoder uses three address bits to set one of eight bits on (and the rest off). For instance, `decode(1,0,0) => (0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0)`. Bits are numbered as usual from right to left starting with 0, so 100 (= 4 decimal) addresses the fifth right-most bit.

Each of the output bits turns on for one specific combination of input. For instance, `o(5) = i(1) AND NOT i(2) AND i(3)`. From this observation, designing the circuit is straightforward.

{{%exercise `Encoder` %}}

* o(2), the high-order address bit, is only set if one of the high-order input bits is set, so:  
`o(2) = i(7) OR i(6) OR i(5) OR i(4)`
* o(0) is only set if one of the odd-numbered inputs is set:   
`o(0) = i(7) OR i(5) OR i(3) OR i(1)`
* And the last when odd pairs are set:  
`o(1) = i(7) OR i(6) OR i(3) OR i(2)`

The design using gates is now trivial.

An **encoder** does the reverse: given inputs one of which is 1 (and the others are 0) an encoder produces the address of the set bit.

* Design an 8 to 3 encoder

{{%exercise `Encoder` %}}

`o = (a AND c) OR (b AND NOT c)`

A multiplexer is an important component which uses one or more controls to copy one of two or more inputs to the output.

A 2-input multiplexer is implemented by the trivial equation for inputs a and b, control c and output o. The circuit follows trivially from the equation.

* Design a 2-input multiplexer.

This idea can be extended to

* more than 1 bit wide inputs
* more than two inputs (requiring more than one controls)
* 'output multiplexing'

*Note: a **demultiplexer** is a component which allows us to copy one input to two or more outputs, based upon controls.*

*Note: a multiplexer can also be made using a decoder by AND-ing each decoder output with one input.*

# Flip-Flops, Latches
{{<figure `SR Latch` `/images/SE/SE1.SR-latch.png` right 40 >}}
![](SE1.SR-latch.png)

Not all components are Boolean functions. ***Flip-flops*** and ***Latches*** are components which maintain an internal state (0 or 1): they are one-bit memories. CPU registers are built from flip-flops and latches.

The simplest form is an SR latch, which has two inputs S and R and two outputs Q and <u>**Q**</u>. If S and R are 0, either Q or <u>**Q**</u> will be 1 (and the other 0) depending on the current state. When S is 1 (and R is 0) the state is ***set***. That is, Q will be set forthwith. When R is set (and S is 0) the state is reset (<u>**Q**</u>=1, Q=0). S and R should never be 1 at the same time because then the output will become unreliable.

Many other flip-flops and latches exist, such as a D-latch which has a control (C) and a data input (D). The internal state is set to D only when C is 1 and is unaltered otherwise.

# Flip-flops & Latches => Registers

Flip-flops and latches (we'll discuss the difference later) can store a bit which can be read or changed using control lines.

Putting flip-flops or latches in a row of 8, 16, 32, 64 or more bits makes a logical component, which is called a **register** and which stores a value: an integer, a character, a float, an address.
