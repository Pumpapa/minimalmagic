![](LogarithmicBarrelShifter.png)

Starting with a functionally trivial 
component, the transistor, we can 
create a multitude of components including

* Memory
* Boolean Logic (NAND, ...)
* Binary & Integer Math (+, -, *, <<, &, !, ...)
* Floating Point Numbers
* Other logic such as Multiplexers, etcetera

With no experience in hardware design I 'invented' this logarithmic barrel shifter. In fact, it was already invented, but the principle remains: ex Ex Principiis Omnia.

Section System Engineering (SE) offers an introduction from these trivial beginnings to the level of micro processors.
