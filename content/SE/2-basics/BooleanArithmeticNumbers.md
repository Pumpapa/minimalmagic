# Booleans

There are two values: ***true*** and ***false***.
Many operations, such as *comparisons*, on other data (e.g. numbers, dates) result in a boolean. For instance: *x>5* is *true* if *x* exceeds 5 and is *false* otherwise.

Truth values can be combined or computed using Boolean operators. 

**AND** yields *true* only if both its arguments are *true*, and yields *false* otherwise (i.e. if one argument or  both are *false*).

For example, you can only join a park ride if your length is between 1.40 and 2.10, and your weight does not exceed 150Kg. `canJoin = (len > 1.40 AND len < 2.10) AND weight < 150`

Other operators include **OR**, **NAND**, **NOR** and **NOT**.

## Boolean Arithmetic

It is sometimes convenient to represent Boolean values as numbers: 0 (*false*) and 1 (*true*). A single bit can be interpreted as an integer or as a Boolean.

When 0 and 1 are used to represent truth values, the **AND** operator is often written as \* . Note that multiplication, when limited to 0 and 1, does indeed compute **AND**: *p* \* *q* only equals 1 if both *p* and *q* are 1.

Similarly, **OR** is written as + and **NOT** is written as unary -. Note that Integer and Boolean + and (unary) - do not coincide with the integer operations: Boolean 1+1 is 1 and -1 is 0.

In many programming languages, AND and OR are often written as `&` and `|`.

<span style="font-size:smaller;">*In programming, identifiers **true** and **false** are generally used to avoid confusion with integers, although in many languages integers can be used as 'truth values'.*</span>

# Truth Tables

![](SE1.NOT-AND-tables.png)

Truth Tables are a technique to compute the value of Boolean expressions. In a truth table all possible values of all variables are listed together with the value of the expression (or its sub-expressions if the expression is complex).

The truth table of NOT and AND are:

## Complex Truth Tables

{{<figure `Complex Truth Tables` `/images/SE/SE1.complex-table.png` right 40 >}}
![](SE1.complex-table.png)

Using truth tables, the value of complex Boolean expressions can be computed even if their value isn't obvious immediately. For instance: what is the value of  


```Prolog {linenos=false}
(p or q ) and not (not p and not q) 
```


Without the truth table it is not immediately clear that this expression
is always *false*.

An important operator is XOR (exclusive or): *p xor q = (p or q) and not (p and q)*.

This operator is important because unlike AND and OR it does not lose information and is therefore useful in encryption: (p xor q) xor p = q. To the right is a common symbol for an XOR gate.

Consider the truth tables of `(not p and q) or (p and not q)` and `p xor q`. From the tables, we see that they are identical!



## Binary Numbers

Most people today use the Arabic Numeral System based on ten digits, which is a positional numbering system where the contribution of a digit to a number is determined by the digit and by its position in the number. So even though the '1' in '12' is a smaller digit than the 2, its contribution is larger because of its position. To be precise: there are 10 digits, so the largest single-digit number is 9. The next number can not be represented using a single digit, so two digits are used: the smallest non-zero digit followed by zero; 10. The 'weight' of the position of the 1 is equal to the number of digits (i.e. ten) so the total value is ten.

Using ten digits at hardware level is impractical, but using two digits does make sense: the digits 0 and 1. Binary also has a number 10, but the weight of the 1 equals now equals two (the number of digits). 

Note the difference between a number and its representation(s):  
This is a number of dots .... .... ....  

* In decimal, the number of dots is written as: 12  
* In binary it is written as: 1100  
* In hexadecimal (which we will revisit) it's written as: c

## Binary to Decimal Conversion

Conversion from binary to decimal is very simple. 

* write down the weights of as many digits as you need
* for every digit 1, add the corresponding weight

For instance, to convert 1001 to decimal, write the weights: 8,4,2,1 (each position the weight is multiplied by two). There are ones at the first and last position so the value is 9.

Note that the weight of the n-th position from the right is 2^n, the n-th power of 2.

## Decimal to Binary Conversion

To convert a decimal number to a binary number do the following:

1. if the number is even, write down a 0
1. if the number is odd, write down a 1 and subtract 1 from the number
1. divide the number by two
1. goto step 1 unless you have reached 0

The digits you have written down are the binary digits **from right to left**.

For instance: convert 91

`(91) 1 (45) 1 (22) 0 (11) 1 (5) 1 (2) 0 (1) 1 (0)`

Binary: `1011011` (check: 1+2+8+16+64=91)

Exercises:

1. Convert the binary number 101 to decimal
2. Convert the decimal number 101 to binary

{{%exercise%}}

1. 1+4 = 5
2. (101) 1 (50) 0 (25) 1 (12) 0 (6) 0 (3) 1 (1) 1 (0) => 1100101

# Binary Arithmetic

{{<figure `Add with Carry` `/images/SE/SE1.add-with-carry.png` right 20 >}}
![](SE1.add-with-carry.png)

Exactly the same rules and methods exist for binary arithmetic as for decimal arithmetic: 1 + 1 can't be 2, so it is 10; that is 0 with a carry 1.

For instance, this is the addition of 1101 and 1011 (check: 13 + 11 = 24).

The tables of multiplication are trivial, so multiplication is a matter of rigorous discipline:

`````
   110
   101
 ----- *
   110
 11000
  ---- +
 11110 (check => 2+4+8+16 = 30)
 
 `````
